Builder image for Maven-built JavaScript Apps (AngularJS for example) also using NPM in the build process

The rules:
- Position your JavaScript app in src/javascript in your sources
- Use a maven pom.xml at the root containing the build instructions (which may include calls to npm)
- Place a file mvnsettings.xml in the project root to let the maven build use it as settings
- Place additional NGINX config files into /src/nginx. They will go to /etc/nginx/default.d/.
- Specify your distribution directory (where the built website is) in variable DISTRO_DIR. Defaults to "./src/javascript"
- The website will be served from /opt/app-root/www. You might want to mount anything inside there.
